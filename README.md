# S.O.L.I.D-Principles
The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. There are rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: 
1. Single Responsibility Principle, 
2. Open-Closed Principle, 
3. Liskov Substitution Principle, 
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle.


00_Example_code.py is an example code for order management in which we add items, calculate the total cost for an order, and complete the order with different payment models.
And from this example, I have tried to break down this code based on the S.O.L.I.D principle.
